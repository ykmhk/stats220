# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Bachelor of Science major in computer science.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I am particularly interested in the practical application of technology, especially like web-based dynamic reporting systems and such.
- I am interested in learning about how data systems operate (from acquisition and processing to automated reporting).

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](pic.jpg)
